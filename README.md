# Misbehavior Prediction of Autonomous Driving System via Motion Features

This project is the implementation of our Paper: [Misbehavior Prediction of Autonomous Driving System via Motion Features), which is submitted to **IEEE Transaction of Software Engineerring.** We proposed a SOTA model for ADS misbehavior Prediciton.

supplement and correction of published paper: 1. In Figure 2(a), $I_{t-1}$ and $I_t$ should be swapped; 2. "Our model is trained on four 2080Ti GPUs for 300 epochs, which takes about 35 hours." This sentence refers to the Cityscapes training set; 3. In Table 1, GFLOPs computing for KITTI is on $256\times832$ and on $1024\times512$ for Cityscapes using [fvcore](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fvcore).
